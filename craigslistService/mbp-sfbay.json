The battery is also brand new with only about 4 cycles on it, and since they're designed to last for at least 1,000 cycles you'll find years of use without issue!

I purchased it for $1300 in May 2015. The price is $1000 but I really want it gone in the next day or two because I need to pay tuition so I am open to negotiation. Please make your best offer. The computer also comes with a screen protector, surface and trackpad protector and a pink keyboard protector. It also has a pink hard shell protective and a polyutherane sleeve and an extra extension cord because I had to purchase a new apple charger after the first one was damaged and it came with another extension cord. The USB port on the left side does not work well, last year something spilled in my bag and got in there, however the right side works perfectly. The charging port is also on the left and works well, but I have never needed thunderbolt so I have no clue whether those were damaged as well or not. Hard case does have cracks on the top corners, and soft case is a little stained. Anyway, $1000 OBO totally open to negotiations so please dont hesitate to make an offer, need gone by the 12th.

Comes with Extras!", "price": "700", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "fairfield / vacaville", "description": "\n         \nHello Craigslist, \n \nI have a 2012 15\" MacBook Pro for sale. Here's a quick list of the specifications for it: \n \n-MacOSX Sierra  \n-Retina display: 15.4-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit display with IPS technology; 2880-by-1800 resolution at 220 pixels per inch with support for millions of colors \n-2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz) with 6MB shared L3 cache \n-8GB of 1600MHz DDR3L onboard memory \n-256GB Harddrive \n-Intel HD Graphics 4000 \n-NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M with 1GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching \n-MagSafe 2 power port \n-Two Thunderbolt ports (up to 10 Gbps) \n-Two USB 3 ports (up to 5 Gbps) \n-HDMI port \n-Headphone port \n-SDXC card slot \n-802.11n Wi-Fi wireless networking;3 IEEE 802.11a/b/g compatible \n-Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology \n-Stereo speakers \n-Dual microphones \n-Full-size backlit keyboard with 78 (U.S.) or 79 (ISO) keys, including 12 function keys and 4 arrow keys (inverted \"T\" arrangement) with ambient light sensor \n-Multi-Touch trackpad for precise cursor control; supports inertial scrolling, pinch, rotate, swipe, three-finger swipe, four-finger swipe, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities \n \nFor any other questions about the specifications, you can find them at the Apple page here: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp653?locale=en_US \n \nI have always kept the laptop in a hard shell case which will come with it. The hard shell case is a little beat up and due to some dust and other things getting in it, the bottom of the MacBook Pro does have some minor scratches on it. However, the inside and top of the MacBook Pro are perfect and show no signs of wear. I've only ever used the laptop for photography work and have just recently upgraded to a desktop so I'm looking to sell my Macbook Pro.  \n \nThe laptop comes with a brand new charger that was bought very recently for it. I also have the original box and manuals for it too. \n \nI'm asking $700 firm for everything and will not go any lower so please do not ask. I'm also not interested in any trades so again, please don't ask. \n \nI'm actually located in Sacramento, but for anyone coming from the Bay Area, I'm willing to meet in Vacaville, but no farther than that. And we'll meet at a local Starbucks so that you can test the wifi and anything else you'd like on it.  \n \nSo, If you've got $700 cash in hand and are willing to drive to me and meet in person, then please feel free to email me or, preferably, text me at 916-Eight-Three-Three-9530. Thanks and have a nice day!

The battery life is great lasting up to 7 hours and it only has about ~350 cycles which is extremely good considering they're rated out of 1,000 cycles before they begin to deteriorate.

It also features a NVIDIA GeForce 9400M \"graphics processor with 256 MB of SDRAM shared with main memory\" and a 13.3\" widescreen TFT active-matrix LED-backlit \"glossy\" display (1280x800 native resolution). \n \nConnectivity includes AirPort Extreme (802.11a/b/g/n), Gigabit Ethernet, two USB 2.0 ports, a single audio in/out port, and a Mini DisplayPort that supports an external display at 2560x1600. \n \nProcessor \n \n Core 2 Duo 2.26GHz \n \nHard Drive \n \n 250GB \n \nMemory \n \n 2GB \n \nWi-Fi? \n \n Yes \n \nDisk Drive \n \n DVDRW \n \nOperating System \n \nMac OS X 10.9, Mavericks \n \nBattery \n \n Holds a charge-Normal \n \nNote: \n \n \n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": "37.318000", "lng": "-122.044900", "postId": "5949726878", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/clt/5949726878.html", "postDate": "2017-01-07T12:41:57-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "Apple Macbook 6,1 13.3 inches", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/clt/5949726878", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:47:08.601571", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Final Cut professionals can ingest, edit, and play back multiple streams of ProRes 422 (HQ), ProRes4444 as well as uncompressed HD 10-bit and 12-bit video while protecting valuable workflows, audio sessions, and other creative media content.

Unless you think you'll need any of those characters then you will have to use the RIGHT SHIFT key. \n-Z button doesn't work \n-Right arrow doesn't work \n \nOther than that it works fine and will come with the original charger but no packaging. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmacbook pro, retina, xps, dell, asus, hp, macbook 13\", macbook 15\"    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/01414_lKcwAp9Zq6T_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00202_84wtug4yOpH_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_2uzgtaeqtuK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01717_gFML8pGc9I9_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01616_gsp25CdH2eB_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01212_kdfiWqB9Sqs_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_fp2I6sdeLrc_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_lbwRBeOE63m_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_i2yCHINrCxX_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_eOYHGSXvECT_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_8Kr69j1g52B_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_2nWUSsDi5SK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_5phf58NsQ2e_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01616_1ozRu9rXob0_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_ep9J6xVt3vL_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_4J9nOAMCYxk_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_fat9X0PsWtk_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_e3LuVYT6LOZ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_6J8QA6cypGy_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_9e0FiuLGEIn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01313_33jN96dxvxz_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_8wue8iUl6ED_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_8HhmmuY4NKA_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_iDrZyqUMCTB_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.719500", "lng": "-122.441100", "postId": "5956626640", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sys/5956626640.html", "postDate": "2017-01-12T13:04:06-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "good Apple Macbook Air", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/sys/5956626640", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:47:59.710722", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

In addition, the magnetic DC helps guide the plug into the system for a quick and secure connection. \nWhen the connection is secure, an LED located at the head of the DC connector will light; an amber light lets you know that your portable is charging, while a green light tells you that you have a full charge. An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives users an even easier and more compact way to travel. \nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage. \nThis power adapter recharges the lithium polymer battery while the system is off, on, or in sleep mode.

It also helps prevent fraying or weakening of the cables over time. In addition, the magnetic DC helps guide the plug into the system for a quick and secure connection. \n \nWhen the connection is secure, an LED located at the head of the DC connector lights up; an amber light lets you know that your notebook is charging, while a green light tells you that you have a full charge. An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives you an even easier and more compact way to travel. \n \nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage. \n \nThis power adapter recharges the lithium polymer battery while the system is off, on, or in sleep mode. It also powers the system if you choose to operate without a battery. \n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": "37.530800", "lng": "-121.971200", "postId": "5950076854", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/sys/5950076854.html", "postDate": "2017-01-07T17:37:04-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/sys/5950076854", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:48:03.491656", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},
