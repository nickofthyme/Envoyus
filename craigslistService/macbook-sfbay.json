It also features a NVIDIA GeForce 9400M \"graphics processor with 256 MB of SDRAM shared with main memory\" and a 13.3\" widescreen TFT active-matrix LED-backlit \"glossy\" display (1280x800 native resolution). \n \nConnectivity includes AirPort Extreme (802.11a/b/g/n), Gigabit Ethernet, two USB 2.0 ports, a single audio in/out port, and a Mini DisplayPort that supports an external display at 2560x1600. \n \nProcessor \n \n Core 2 Duo 2.26GHz \n \nHard Drive \n \n 250GB \n \nMemory \n \n 2GB \n \nWi-Fi? \n \n Yes \n \nDisk Drive \n \n DVDRW \n \nOperating System \n \nMac OS X 10.9, Mavericks \n \nBattery \n \n Holds a charge-Normal \n \nNote: \n \n \n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": "37.318000", "lng": "-122.044900", "postId": "5949726878", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/clt/5949726878.html", "postDate": "2017-01-07T12:41:57-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "Apple Macbook 6,1 13.3 inches", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/clt/5949726878", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:47:04.364039", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Comes with Extras!", "price": "700", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "fairfield / vacaville", "description": "\n         \nHello Craigslist, \n \nI have a 2012 15\" MacBook Pro for sale. Here's a quick list of the specifications for it: \n \n-MacOSX Sierra  \n-Retina display: 15.4-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit display with IPS technology; 2880-by-1800 resolution at 220 pixels per inch with support for millions of colors \n-2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz) with 6MB shared L3 cache \n-8GB of 1600MHz DDR3L onboard memory \n-256GB Harddrive \n-Intel HD Graphics 4000 \n-NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M with 1GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching \n-MagSafe 2 power port \n-Two Thunderbolt ports (up to 10 Gbps) \n-Two USB 3 ports (up to 5 Gbps) \n-HDMI port \n-Headphone port \n-SDXC card slot \n-802.11n Wi-Fi wireless networking;3 IEEE 802.11a/b/g compatible \n-Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology \n-Stereo speakers \n-Dual microphones \n-Full-size backlit keyboard with 78 (U.S.) or 79 (ISO) keys, including 12 function keys and 4 arrow keys (inverted \"T\" arrangement) with ambient light sensor \n-Multi-Touch trackpad for precise cursor control; supports inertial scrolling, pinch, rotate, swipe, three-finger swipe, four-finger swipe, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities \n \nFor any other questions about the specifications, you can find them at the Apple page here: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp653?locale=en_US \n \nI have always kept the laptop in a hard shell case which will come with it. The hard shell case is a little beat up and due to some dust and other things getting in it, the bottom of the MacBook Pro does have some minor scratches on it. However, the inside and top of the MacBook Pro are perfect and show no signs of wear. I've only ever used the laptop for photography work and have just recently upgraded to a desktop so I'm looking to sell my Macbook Pro.  \n \nThe laptop comes with a brand new charger that was bought very recently for it. I also have the original box and manuals for it too. \n \nI'm asking $700 firm for everything and will not go any lower so please do not ask. I'm also not interested in any trades so again, please don't ask. \n \nI'm actually located in Sacramento, but for anyone coming from the Bay Area, I'm willing to meet in Vacaville, but no farther than that. And we'll meet at a local Starbucks so that you can test the wifi and anything else you'd like on it.  \n \nSo, If you've got $700 cash in hand and are willing to drive to me and meet in person, then please feel free to email me or, preferably, text me at 916-Eight-Three-Three-9530. Thanks and have a nice day!

An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives users an even easier and more compact way to travel. \nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage. \nThis power adapter recharges the lithium polymer battery while the system is off, on, or in sleep mode.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms.

A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

CALL / TEXT: 65O-TWO-9O-TWO-397  TOP CASH PAID\n\n\n Hayden Separator Antique Shop A Very Merry CHRISTMAS to You All! 2nd Annual Christmas Present Special With each purchase over $50.00-$99.99 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in red paper. With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you!\n\n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5957305052", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/wad/5957305052.html", "postDate": "2017-01-13T04:27:07-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5957305052", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:48:02.004198", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old.

Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W. ANY OF MY NEWSPAPERS OR MAGAZINES may be inspected (AT THE COUNTER) after you pay for them. You will clearly see they are complete and authentic \n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5955623987", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/wad/5955623987.html", "postDate": "2017-01-11T18:48:48-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5955623987", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:48:07.885746", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W. ANY OF MY NEWSPAPERS OR MAGAZINES may be inspected (AT THE COUNTER) after you pay for them. You will clearly see they are complete and authentic \n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5955416219", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/wad/5955416219.html", "postDate": "2017-01-11T15:33:02-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5955416219", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:48:14.074889", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms.

CALL / TEXT: 65O-TWO-9O-TWO-397  TOP CASH PAID Hayden Separator Antique Shop A Very Merry CHRISTMAS to You All! 2nd Annual Christmas Present Special With each purchase over $50.00-$99.99 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in red paper. With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you! \n\n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5954482295", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/wad/5954482295.html", "postDate": "2017-01-11T04:57:26-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5954482295", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:48:17.137409", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

CALL / TEXT: 65O-TWO-9O-TWO-397  TOP CASH PAID Hayden Separator Antique Shop A Very Merry CHRISTMAS to You All! 2nd Annual Christmas Present Special With each purchase over $50.00-$99.99 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in red paper. With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you! \n\n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5954495257", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/wad/5954495257.html", "postDate": "2017-01-11T05:15:24-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5954495257", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:48:17.443227", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Blue Moon has a few starter spaces perfect for the beginner and a few med/large spaces for those of you with lots of stuff. Come join the best at Blue Moon. Heated, cooled and advertised all under one business, Blue Moon. Most Unique Gifts for Dad or Grand Dads......... I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you! \n\n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5954484692", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/wad/5954484692.html", "postDate": "2017-01-11T05:01:04-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5954484692", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:48:23.670629", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year.

It also helps prevent fraying or weakening of the cables over time. In addition, the magnetic DC helps guide the plug into the system for a quick and secure connection. \nWhen the connection is secure, an LED located at the head of the DC connector lights up; an amber light lets you know that your notebook is charging, while a green light tells you that you have a full charge. An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives you an even easier and more compact way to travel. \nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage. \nThis power adapter recharges the lithium polymer battery while the system is off, on, or in sleep mode. It also powers the system if you choose to operate without a battery. \nCompatible with MacBook Pro with Retina display. \n \n \n \n \n \n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": "37.398300", "lng": "-122.000600", "postId": "5942342887", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/sop/5942342887.html", "postDate": "2017-01-02T11:12:07-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-12T11:43:52-0800", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/sop/5942342887", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:49:25.543141", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

I purchased it for $1300 in May 2015. The price is $1000 but I really want it gone in the next day or two because I need to pay tuition so I am open to negotiation. Please make your best offer. The computer also comes with a screen protector, surface and trackpad protector and a pink keyboard protector. It also has a pink hard shell protective and a polyutherane sleeve and an extra extension cord because I had to purchase a new apple charger after the first one was damaged and it came with another extension cord. The USB port on the left side does not work well, last year something spilled in my bag and got in there, however the right side works perfectly. The charging port is also on the left and works well, but I have never needed thunderbolt so I have no clue whether those were damaged as well or not. Anyway, $1000 OBO totally open to negotiations so please dont hesitate to make an offer, need gone by the 12th.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business.

A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services.

Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound.

Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

I have other computers available that you can view by clicking on the \"more ads by this user\" box and even some that aren't listed on Craigslist yet so feel free to ask if you're looking for something else. I can also do custom orders as well such as installing dual hard drives, making fusion drives, upgrading ram, etc.  \n \n \nThis specific computer has an upgraded quad core Intel i7 processor, upgraded 8 GB of 1333 MHz ram, upgraded AMB Radeon graphics with 1 GB of GDDR5 video memory, a speedy 1,000 GB and a long lasting battery with up to 7 hours of typical use!  \nIt has been gently used with very little cosmetic \"damage\" in the form of a handful of small nicks and very light \"scratches\" on the body due to normal use over the years. You can expect most of the damage to be on the bottom cover as that's abused the most but nothing too bad or out of the ordinary. This is a company computer so it has never been dropped, damaged, or had any liquid spills. Everything is working perfectly such as the keyboard, trackpad, display, camera, USB ports and other peripherals. The battery life is great lasting up to 7 hours and it only has about ~350 cycles which is extremely good considering they're rated out of 1,000 cycles before they begin to deteriorate. You're more than welcome to test everything out before purchasing and I'd be happy to help you make sure everything is in tip top shape.  \n \nMacBook Pro 15\", 2011 \n- 2.2 GHz Intel i7 Processor  \n- 8 GB 1333 MHz RAM \n- 1,000 GB HD \n- 512 MB Intel HD Graphics 3000 \n- 1024 MB AMD Radeon  \n- ~30 Cycles! (Battery is rated for 1,000 cycles before it begins to fail) \n- Includes original Apple charger and extension cord \n \nThis computer also comes with the latest version of macOS Sierra along with $3,000 in new, licensed software such as the full Adobe CS6 Suite which includes 17 fully licensed, working programs like Photoshop CS6, After Effects CS6, Illustrator CS6, Indesign CS6 and more. It also comes with the newest versions of Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro X, Screenflow and Microsoft Office 2016. \n \nI am asking for $600 cash, no credit cards, PayPal, checks, shipping or trades. I can also provide a proof of sale at the time of purchase. \n \nPRICE IS FIRM. \n \nFeel free to call or text me at \n  \nand please tell me which computer you are interested since I have other computers listed as well.

The screen is perfect no dead pixels, there are some very minor surface scratches on the underside of the case.  \n \nI love the screen size, great for watch TV in bed or editing video on on the go. It's powerful and quick running programs etc. \n \nUsed to use it to edit video hence the eSATA port (fastest connector at the time) will include an eSATA card for connection to external eSATA drives as it will still edit fast 2k or reduced res 4k. \n \nThe MacBook Pro will be fully erased and with a fresh copy of Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) you can upgrade to El Capitan OS X 10.11 (the last version it can run) very easily with a quick download. It will power up ready for you to put in your own details as if purchased new. \n \nWill come with charger , eSATA express card and Snow Leopard OS disk. \n \nAny questions just ask.  \n \nNOTE I ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED IT ON THE WAY TO SELL AND  NOW NEEDS A NEW LOGIC BOARD FML!!!

Great to take to school, doesn't weigh down the backpack at all. No need to bring a cord for charging because the battery lasts all day long. Speakers are nice a loud. Has a headphone jack for those nice audiophile headphones you just bought. Backlit keyboard so you can surf the web at night and in the dark. Did I mention this thing is thin?
