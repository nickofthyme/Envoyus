I have other computers available that you can view by clicking on the \"more ads by this user\" box and even some that aren't listed on Craigslist yet so feel free to ask if you're looking for something else.

This means the computer itself will automatically manage what files go on which hard drive so that the operating system, programs and files you use the most are available in an instant and load up to 10 times faster than a traditional hard drive! The battery is also brand new with only about 4 cycles on it, and since they're designed to last for at least 1,000 cycles you'll find years of use without issue! Everything is working perfectly including all ports and peripherals like camera, microphone, bluetooth and keyboard.

{"title":"Upgraded 17\" MacBook Pro + software","price":"1100","priceUnit":"$","cityName":"danville / san ramon","description":"\n         \nHi! I have an awesome 17\" MacBook Pro for sale! It''s in great condition and it's very fast! The display is absolutely gorgeous and colors and details pop. Unfortunately, Apple stopped producing these beautiful 17\" MacBook Pros, and it's a shame, but here is your chance to get one. Theses 17\" MBP's are getting harder to find and are becoming a rarity. It's running El Capitan 10.11.6. The features, upgrades, and software is listed below. \n \n \nFeatures: \n \n 128 SSD (Boots in 12-15 seconds, shutdowns in 3-5 seconds.) \n 4 GB Ram \n Super Drive burner: Burns DVD's and CD's \n Glossy 17\" backlit HD Display  \n Backlit keyboard  \n \"multi-touch gesturing\" trackpad  \n Compatible with the Apple remote  \n \nUpgrades: \n \n 128 SSD (Upgraded from stock 5400 RPM hard drive) ($200 value) \n 4 GB of RAM, upgraded from stock 2 GB of RAM. ($100 value) \n Operating System: Mac OSX El Capitan (10.11.6) \n \nApple Professional software (Fresh installs): \n \n✔ Complete Adobe CS6 Suite: Audition, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, Flash Builder, Illustrator, In Design, Photoshop, Prelude, Premiere, Speed Grade \n✔ Garage Band 2016 \n✔ Garage Band 2012 \n✔ Logic Pro X 2015 \n✔ Logic Pro X 2013 \n✔ Final Cut Pro X 2016 \n✔ Final Cut Pro 7 \n✔ iMovie 2015 \n✔ iMovie 2011 \n✔ Microsoft Office '16 (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, One Note, Outlook) \n✔ Microsoft Office '11 (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook) \n✔ iWork 2016 (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) \n✔ iWork '09 (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) \n✔ Compressor 2014 \n✔ Main Stage 3 \n✔ Motion 5 \n✔ CleanMyMac3, App Cleaner \n✔ Color, Cinema Tools, \n✔ iWeb, iDVD, and Photos (iPhoto is now called Photos) \n \nMacBook Pro comes with 85 Watt Magsafe charger.  \n \nThe battery only has 42 load-cycles so it holds a pretty good charge for a 17\".  \n \nThis is a steal since it has over $3,000 worth of professional software installed, and this upgraded MacBook Pro is in excellent condition.  \n \nIt was $3,000 + Tax when it was brand new from Apple. I'm the second owner. I'm only selling it because I recently bought a new MacBook Pro.  \n \nThis MacBook Pro is awesome, and you won't find one on Craigslist this nice and complete with all of the software that you need. It's perfect for any type of user.  \n \n$1,100 Firm.. \n \nIf interested, please text me at \n  \n \n \nSerious inquires only.  \n \nThanks! \n    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_5AXZg6eC1bI_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00000_59DUx1PxjxB_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_cmxr8tIHTz_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_2NHR0BDrzJY_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_iQFOikl1yyn_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_2kZXyHWUt2Y_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_6QA3AcLHbfD_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_h1k7g5NmeV6_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_6owQNHhhHnT_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_6uUnat1WjPq_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_lTVyoqCq1U0_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_8JvMPJ6fxms_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00606_jcW1c9ihSwd_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_fX0GhW9Ou9w_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01111_iWgOKGaJlHS_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00000_arXXgPNk7y9_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_3zEfMlYp7ey_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_7pKpZVyMKZQ_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_67uXEcobrEb_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_2GVpB008tF1_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_7i2cepUo8a_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_3k24dBtBPrc_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00606_hZqf9oOuMxR_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_czsd02Ifcce_600x450.jpg"],"lat":"37.814000","lng":"-121.966000","postId":"5948869611","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/sys/5948869611.html","postDate":"2017-01-06T19:40:33-0800","updateDate":"2017-01-10T18:34:30-0800","attributes":"excellent Apple MacBook Pro 17\"","locAccuracy":"high","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/sys/5948869611","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:46:03.997381","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

With its memory and SSD upgrades, this Macbook Pro has remained fast enough for my usage (mostly as a desktop replacement for code development, internet browsing), even with multiple apps running and a bunch of browser tabs open.  \n \nUpgrades / Extras: \n- Added a second 4GB memory card so the machine has 8GB memory total \n- Replaced the optical drive with a 256 GB Samsung Evo SSD \n- Comes with a vertical Henge Dock docking station with original packaging \n- Comes with original Apple packaging, including the power charger and original optical drive  \n \nDisclaimers: \n- Apple prevents upgrading the OS on this machine beyond El Capitan 10.11.6 \n- The system report says the battery needs replacing, though it still charges to 4156 mAh and has only 200 cycles on it. I find the battery adequate for a couple hours but am usually plugged in. \n- The optical drive has been separated from the machine, you won't be able to use CDs/DVDs \n- There is a dent in the bottom right corner of the aluminum casing - purely cosmetic \n- There are some scratches and sticker residue on the aluminum casing    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_iA6d4FBPWN2_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00808_lAmZET4S9gq_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00303_8GVUKHwHeHP_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_cvegPP8N8pQ_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_d7srzWovYUV_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_2mx44UNjE1c_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_9kYxcpCA1E5_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_9eAqE4CDjeT_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_7wdVLxvpFuc_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_cNWyn7eIAqG_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_eIcQiyBG6Zh_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_fkOiCFqbDiW_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_1eL3TJoPLMV_600x450.jpg"],"lat":"37.788895","lng":"-122.433872","postId":"5946706475","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sys/5946706475.html","postDate":"2017-01-05T10:02:29-0800","updateDate":"2017-01-10T21:28:32-0800","attributes":"good Apple Macbook Pro 15\"","locAccuracy":"highest","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/sys/5946706475","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:46:05.402233","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

Reason being: I bought a new laptop. $900 OBO. \n \nThis MacBook was bought in 2012. Always cased, always babied. Used for school. \n \nAs you can see from the pictures, this is a special kind of MacBook Pro. It has the internals of the Retina Display i7 Laptop.

I purchased it for $1300 in May 2015. The price is $1000 but I really want it gone in the next day or two because I need to pay tuition so I am open to negotiation. Please make your best offer. The computer also comes with a screen protector, surface and trackpad protector and a pink keyboard protector. It also has a pink hard shell protective and a polyutherane sleeve and an extra extension cord because I had to purchase a new apple charger after the first one was damaged and it came with another extension cord. The USB port on the left side does not work well, last year something spilled in my bag and got in there, however the right side works perfectly. The charging port is also on the left and works well, but I have never needed thunderbolt so I have no clue whether those were damaged as well or not.

{"title":"APPLE 85W MAGSAFE POWER ADAPTER (for MacBook Pro with Retina display)","price":"60","priceUnit":"$","cityName":"milpitas","description":"\n         \nUNOPENED. BRAND NEW BOX. \n \n \n \nThe 85W MagSafe 2 Power Adapter features a magnetic DC connector so if someone should trip over it, the cord disconnects harmlessly and your MacBook Pro stays put safely. It also helps prevent fraying or weakening of the cables over time. In addition, the magnetic DC helps guide the plug into the system for a quick and secure connection. \n \nWhen the connection is secure, an LED located at the head of the DC connector lights up; an amber light lets you know that your notebook is charging, while a green light tells you that you have a full charge. An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives you an even easier and more compact way to travel. \n \nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage. \n \nThis power adapter recharges the lithium polymer battery while the system is off, on, or in sleep mode. It also powers the system if you choose to operate without a battery. \n \nCompatible with MacBook Pro with Retina display. \n    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_f53eUGIOJH0_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_fEGMzlwgryX_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_4b3XoVtAE4_600x450.jpg"],"lat":"37.372900","lng":"-121.856000","postId":"5956272558","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/ele/5956272558.html","postDate":"2017-01-12T09:30:56-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"APPLE 85W MAGSAFE 2","locAccuracy":"high","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/ele/5956272558","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:46:23.607590","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

{"title":"2012 15\" MacBook Pro with Retina Display for Sale! Comes with Extras!","price":"700","priceUnit":"$","cityName":"fairfield / vacaville","description":"\n         \nHello Craigslist, \n \nI have a 2012 15\" MacBook Pro for sale. Here's a quick list of the specifications for it: \n \n-MacOSX Sierra  \n-Retina display: 15.4-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit display with IPS technology; 2880-by-1800 resolution at 220 pixels per inch with support for millions of colors \n-2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz) with 6MB shared L3 cache \n-8GB of 1600MHz DDR3L onboard memory \n-256GB Harddrive \n-Intel HD Graphics 4000 \n-NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M with 1GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching \n-MagSafe 2 power port \n-Two Thunderbolt ports (up to 10 Gbps) \n-Two USB 3 ports (up to 5 Gbps) \n-HDMI port \n-Headphone port \n-SDXC card slot \n-802.11n Wi-Fi wireless networking;3 IEEE 802.11a/b/g compatible \n-Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology \n-Stereo speakers \n-Dual microphones \n-Full-size backlit keyboard with 78 (U.S.) or 79 (ISO) keys, including 12 function keys and 4 arrow keys (inverted \"T\" arrangement) with ambient light sensor \n-Multi-Touch trackpad for precise cursor control; supports inertial scrolling, pinch, rotate, swipe, three-finger swipe, four-finger swipe, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities \n \nFor any other questions about the specifications, you can find them at the Apple page here: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp653?locale=en_US \n \nI have always kept the laptop in a hard shell case which will come with it. The hard shell case is a little beat up and due to some dust and other things getting in it, the bottom of the MacBook Pro does have some minor scratches on it. However, the inside and top of the MacBook Pro are perfect and show no signs of wear. I've only ever used the laptop for photography work and have just recently upgraded to a desktop so I'm looking to sell my Macbook Pro.  \n \nThe laptop comes with a brand new charger that was bought very recently for it. I also have the original box and manuals for it too. \n \nI'm asking $700 firm for everything and will not go any lower so please do not ask. I'm also not interested in any trades so again, please don't ask. \n \nI'm actually located in Sacramento, but for anyone coming from the Bay Area, I'm willing to meet in Vacaville, but no farther than that. And we'll meet at a local Starbucks so that you can test the wifi and anything else you'd like on it.  \n \nSo, If you've got $700 cash in hand and are willing to drive to me and meet in person, then please feel free to email me or, preferably, text me at 916-Eight-Three-Three-9530. Thanks and have a nice day!

Keyboard and Trackpad have already been tethered to the Macbook Pro with fresh batteries installed so all you have to do is turn everything on and you are all connected! Being a 2011 model Macbook there is normal wear and tear, and some additional damage on the corner of the exterior body (see pictures). This damage has absolutely no affect on the functionality of the machine, and it is still fast and great to use like all Macbooks are! The Macbook has been freshly wiped (500GB Hard Drive) and is ready for it's next lucky owner to take over. All accessories have NO DAMAGE and are in LIKE NEW condition! This bundle is a great value and will make for a perfect holiday gift for someone special. Please see some more detailed specifications and attached pictures below! \n \n\"The MacBook Pro \"Core i7\" 2.2 15-Inch (Early 2011/Thunderbolt) features a 32 nm \"Sandy Bridge\" 2.2 GHz Intel \"Core i7\" processor (2720QM), with four independent processor \"cores\" on a single silicon chip, a 6 MB shared level 3 cache, 8 GB of 1333 MHz DDR3 SDRAM (PC3-10600) installed in pairs (two 2 GB modules), a 500 GB Serial ATA (5400 RPM) hard drive, an 8X DL \"SuperDrive\", dual graphics processors -- an AMD Radeon HD 6750M with 1 GB of dedicated GDDR5 memory and an Intel HD Graphics 3000 graphics processor that shares 384 MB of memory with the system -- and an integrated FaceTime HD webcam. \n \nThe standard configuration of this model has an LED-backlit 15.4\" widescreen TFT active-matrix \"glossy\" display (1440x900 native resolution), but it also was available via custom configuration with a \"high-resolution glossy\" 1680x1050 display and a \"high-resolution antiglare\" 1680x1050 display for an additional US$100 and US$150, respectively. \n \nConnectivity includes AirPort Extreme (802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, Gigabit Ethernet, a Firewire \"800\" port, two USB 2.0 ports, separate audio in and out ports, an SDXC card slot, and a new \"Thunderbolt\" port that is backwards compatible with Mini DisplayPort and, likewise, supports an external display at 2560x1600 and passes an audio signal. Thunderbolt also supports other peripherals that use the Thunderbolt standard which provides up to 10 Gbps of bandwidth in both directions.\" \n \n \nI'm asking for a strict $500 CASH ONLY offer, with the ability to meet me at a nearby public space.

I have other computers available that you can view by clicking on the \"more ads by this user\" box and even some that aren't listed on Craigslist yet so feel free to ask if you're looking for something else. I can also do custom orders as well such as installing dual hard drives, making fusion drives, upgrading ram, etc.  \n \n \nThis specific computer has an upgraded quad core Intel i7 processor, upgraded 8 GB of 1333 MHz ram, upgraded AMB Radeon graphics with 1 GB of GDDR5 video memory, a speedy 1,000 GB and a long lasting battery with up to 7 hours of typical use!  \nIt has been gently used with very little cosmetic \"damage\" in the form of a handful of small nicks and very light \"scratches\" on the body due to normal use over the years. You can expect most of the damage to be on the bottom cover as that's abused the most but nothing too bad or out of the ordinary. This is a company computer so it has never been dropped, damaged, or had any liquid spills. Everything is working perfectly such as the keyboard, trackpad, display, camera, USB ports and other peripherals. The battery life is great lasting up to 7 hours and it only has about ~350 cycles which is extremely good considering they're rated out of 1,000 cycles before they begin to deteriorate. You're more than welcome to test everything out before purchasing and I'd be happy to help you make sure everything is in tip top shape.  \n \nMacBook Pro 15\", 2011 \n- 2.2 GHz Intel i7 Processor  \n- 8 GB 1333 MHz RAM \n- 1,000 GB HD \n- 512 MB Intel HD Graphics 3000 \n- 1024 MB AMD Radeon  \n- ~30 Cycles!

It also comes with the newest versions of Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro X, Screenflow and Microsoft Office 2016. \n \nI am asking for $600 cash, no credit cards, PayPal, checks, shipping or trades. I can also provide a proof of sale at the time of purchase. \n \nPRICE IS FIRM. \n \nFeel free to call or text me at \n  \nand please tell me which computer you are interested since I have other computers listed as well.

Final Cut professionals can ingest, edit, and play back multiple streams of ProRes 422 (HQ), ProRes4444 as well as uncompressed HD 10-bit and 12-bit video while protecting valuable workflows, audio sessions, and other creative media content. Pegasus2 also works well for popular applications such as iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, Garageband, Photoshop, and media center applications. \n \nSimple, flexible, and cost-effective backup solutions \n \nFast, safe, and reliable external storage is essential when protecting your valuable files such as music, photos, and videos.

The product supports 32 bit color at resolutions up to 2560x1600 and its mouse and keyboard emulation ensures uninterrupted operation when switching computers. \n \nIt utilizes 2 convenient switching methods; the first is a simple pushbutton on a remote switch that fits on any desired locations on your desk, and the second is by hotkey that allows you to independently switch and control functions between computers. \n \nEquipped with IOGEAR's DynaSync* technology which remembers your monitor's ideal resolution and refresh rate, the GCS982U boots all your computers simultaneously and switches back and forth between the two computers while still maintaining the ideal resolution of the monitor. \n \nThis 2-port KVM also offers a cost effective solution to increase security by allowing users to switch between the Internet connected PC and an Intranet connected PC. \n \n \nOne dual-link DVI console controls two dual-link DVI / USB computers \nSeparate the Internet and Intranet with the click of a button \nDual-link DVI resolution up to 2560x1600 @ 60Hz \nPort switching via remote switch button, mouse or hotkeys \nHotkeys allows independent KVM and audio switching between computers \n2.1 stereo sound and microphone support \nUSB 2.0 Peripheral Sharing via mouse port - Connect a powered USB hub to expand your USB connectivity* \nIOGEAR's DynaSync** technology reads and remembers the monitor's parameters (EDID) so there is no delay or change of video resolution when switching between, or booting computers \nUSB mouse and keyboard emulation for error-free boot-up and instantaneous recognition when switching computers \nPower-On Detection - If one of the computers is powered off, it will automatically switch to the next powered-on computer \nRe-programmable Hotkey activation for keyboards without a Scroll Lock key \nMouse emulation can be disabled to support mice with special keys \nMac and Sun keyboard support \nFirmware upgradeable \nPlug-n-Play; No software required \n \n \n \n    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_enrficGmhAo_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_9zYSHElRPRD_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_cFA9VvE9Cfi_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_371zOVGyXEX_600x450.jpg"],"lat":"37.573500","lng":"-122.322500","postId":"5949986364","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/sys/5949986364.html","postDate":"2017-01-07T16:03:04-0800","updateDate":"2017-01-10T14:37:56-0800","attributes":"","locAccuracy":"high","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/sys/5949986364","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:47:41.502974","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

It also helps prevent fraying or weakening of the cables over time. In addition, the magnetic DC helps guide the plug into the system for a quick and secure connection. \n \nWhen the connection is secure, an LED located at the head of the DC connector lights up; an amber light lets you know that your notebook is charging, while a green light tells you that you have a full charge. An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives you an even easier and more compact way to travel. \n \nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage. \n \n    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/01111_6BXhpOU8l5o_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_f8JXSYRnrMa_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_4SFmeYYDv25_600x450.jpg"],"lat":"37.766895","lng":"-122.188418","postId":"5956854296","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/sop/5956854296.html","postDate":"2017-01-12T15:48:48-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"new Apple 60W MagSafe 2","locAccuracy":"high","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/sop/5956854296","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:47:47.667485","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

I purchased it for $1300 in May 2015. The price is $1000 but I really want it gone in the next day or two because I need to pay tuition so I am open to negotiation. Please make your best offer. The computer also comes with a screen protector, surface and trackpad protector and a pink keyboard protector. It also has a pink hard shell protective and a polyutherane sleeve and an extra extension cord because I had to purchase a new apple charger after the first one was damaged and it came with another extension cord. The USB port on the left side does not work well, last year something spilled in my bag and got in there, however the right side works perfectly.

They replaced the entire display because the screen was defective AND they replaced the logic board at the same time. \n \nBasically, that turned this into a brand new machine, except for the SSD and a couple very small dings on the corner.

If you use the case, it covers the above-mentioned dings completely. \n \nFull specs can be found here: http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.5-15-dual-graphics-mid-2014-retina-display-specs.html \n \nThe machine has been wiped, with a fresh install of OSX 10.11 El Capitan put back. However, if you would prefer OSX 10.12 Sierra, that can be installed once you've agreed to buy it. \n \nAs with all used machines, Sale is Final.

Although there was nothing wrong with the original hard drive, I simply needed more storage so I upgraded. The original 320GB spinning drive (HDD) is included with the laptop. \n \nAlthough there's a missing a screw on the bottom and a few scratches/dots/blemishes from usual wear and tear, the computer is in overall great condition and doesn't seem any slower than the day I bought it. \n \nAlong with a brand new, full length charger (as pictured), the laptop include the following tech specs: \n- Intel Core i5 @ 2.3ghz \n- OS X EL CAPITAN 10.11 \n- 320GB Hard Drive \n- 4GB Ram \n- Intel HD Graphics 3000 384MB \n- max resolution: 1280 x 800 \n- 2 USB PORTS \n-1 THUNDERBOLT PORT \n- 1 FIREWIRE PORT  \n- 1 NETWORK PORT \n- 1 SD CARD PORT  \n- 1 HEADPHONE JACK  \n \nSince I wiped the laptop after transferring my data over to my new computer, it only comes with software preinstalled with El Capitan. With that being said, I can install Microsoft Office Suite 2013 if wanted by buyer. \n \nI can also throw in the plastic casing that has protected the laptop from the day I bought it (as pictured) if wanted.
